# CommitWithBranchName
A swift script that would allow to append the branch name to the commit message. This is specifically useful for projects that use Atlassian environment, where the ticket name in JIRA is linked to the branch. In such cases by appending the branch name to the commit message would give a quick link to the ticket when viewed on bitbucket console.
Any other environment that has such functionality can use this.
