# CommitWithBranchName
A swift script that would allow to append the branch name to the commit message. This is specifically useful for projects that use Atlassian environment, where the ticket name in JIRA is linked to the branch. In such cases by appending the branch name to the commit message would give a quick link to the ticket when viewed on bitbucket console.
Any other environment that has such functionality can use this.

For example, lets say the project abbrevation on JIRA is MYPROJ. Its ticket would have convention like MYPROJ-123. When a branch is created related to that ticket in Bitbucket then by having commits such as: `MYPROJ-123 initial commit` would link that commit to the ticket. You can also navigate from bitbucket commit link to the JIRA ticket directly if the commit is in this format.
